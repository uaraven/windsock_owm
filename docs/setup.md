## Configuring Windosck OWM with OpenWeather API Key

You will need your own API key to use OpenWeather service. Obtaining one is free. Go to [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) website and create an account, then navigate to "API keys" tab.


You may want to double check that you're on Free plan in the "Billing plans" tab.
